    <h2>My favourite hobby</h2>
      <p>My favourite hobby is drawing.In my free time, I like to draw sketches , color drawings and draw paintings on canvas.I always look for new things which I can draw. I got drawing as my hobby at the age of 5.   Since standard 1, I have been going classes for drawing . My drawing teacher is a professional artist. I like to learn drawing from him.</p>
    <p> Drawing is a form of visual art in which one uses various drawing instruments to mark paper or another two-dimensional medium. Instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, various kinds of erasers, markers, styluses.I have a collection of drawing instruments such as oil pastels, color pencils, water colors,shading pencils etc.</p>
    <p>Drawing is one of the oldest forms of human expression, with evidence for its existence preceding that of written communication.I t has been used by man since the paleolithic age . We have examples such as cave paintings used to depict information of old age drawn by man of those times.Really, drawing is the heart or soul of an artistâ€™s way to express themselves.</p>
      <p>There have been many forms of drawing:Life drawing, illustration drawing, geometric drawing, perspective drawing ,emotive drawing , diagrammatic drawing and analytic  drawing. Analytic drawing is my most favourite form of drawing.</p>

      <h1>My inspiration</h1>
          <p> I want to improve myself in drawing . My inspiration is Vincent Van Gogh who was a great artist who made the painting 'Starry Night'.He was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art.</p>
